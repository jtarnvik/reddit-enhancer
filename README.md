# reddit-enhancer - A simple Safari RES variant.

A user script for Safari which can be added using e.g. Tampermonkey.

This script has limited functionality and so far does only has these features:
- Adds inifinate scroll.
- When a item is hidden, it removes the placeholder.
- Removes the cross-post, share and report buttons.

## Mostly for Safari
On chrome RES is several orders of magnitude better.
